    "1. MongoDB is a popular, open-source, NoSQL (non-relational) database management system. It is designed to handle large amounts of data, particularly unstructured and semi-structured data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. MongoDB is known for its flexibility, scalability, and high performance.\n",
    "A non-relational database (NoSQL) is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored. For example, data may be stored as simple key/value pairs, as JSON documents, or as a graph consisting of edges and vertices.\n",

    "MongoDB is a non-relational database that is often preferred over SQL databases for applications that require:\n",
    "\n",
    "High scalability: MongoDB can be scaled horizontally, meaning that it can be easily expanded by adding more nodes to the database cluster. This makes it ideal for applications that need to handle large amounts of data.\n",
    "Flexible data model: MongoDB does not have a fixed schema, which means that data can be stored in a variety of formats, including JSON documents, key/value pairs, and graphs. This makes it ideal for applications that need to store a variety of data types.\n",
    "High performance: MongoDB can often outperform SQL databases for certain types of queries. This is because it is designed to store and access data in a way that is optimized for the specific application."
